          p Ray Charles was born in Georgia in 1930. He pioneered the genre soul music in the 1950s. His musical curiosity was sparked by man named Pitman who played boogie woogie on an old upright piano at his cafe. Afterward Pitman taught Ray how to play the piano himself and always welcomed Ray’s family to the cafe, as well as allowing them live there during financial troubles. He suffered a traumatic experience when his younger brother drowned right in front of his eyes. Soon after his brother death, he started to lose his vision and became completely blind by the age of 7.  He went to the Florida School for the Deaf and the Blind in St.Augustine, Florida. This where he learned to read, write and arrange music in braille, this where he also learned to play piano, organ, sax, clarinet and trumpet.
